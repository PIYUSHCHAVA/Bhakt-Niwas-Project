                (The information based on the original documents of Sansthan) 

              In the holy presence of Shri Gajanan Maharaj the body of 12 trustees was unanimously formed on 12-09-1908 with an objective to co-memorate this holy place where Shree hinted for Samadhi.<br>
              On 12-09-1909 a joint meeting was held as per the instructions of Maharaj in the grocery shop of Late Narayan Kadtaji Patil, where Shree’s devotees, Shegaon’s citizens and tradesmen had a brainstorming on the arrangements to be made in the Sansthan. 
              Maharaj also present in this meeting. ThusSansthan’s first working committee was established.<br>
              The most important feature of the Shree Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan is that is was formed in the presence of Shree Gajanan Maharaj in the year 1908 by His divine grace. His yogic prowess enabled Him to specify the date and place of His samadhi well in advance. His words ‘Ya jaagi raaheel’ meaning ‘Will stay here’ were prophetic. Through the initiative of His closest disciples, a conference comprising of Shree’s devotees and the villagers and businesspersons of Shegaon was organized at late Shri Narayan Kadtaji Patil’s store on 12thSeptember 1908 (Ashwin shukla 1, Sanvat 1885), under the guidance of Shree Gajanan Maharaj according to His instructions. 
              The Sansthan came into existence in His divine presence.<br>
